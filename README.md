## Background

Ellsworth Kelly has been an american painter and sculptor that I discovered by mistake while mindlessly scrolling through my Instagram feed.
He became famous thanks to his beautiful style, now called *"hard-edge painting"*, where each of his canvas was composed by simple color palettes and shapes all abruptly interrupting each other.

*Spectrum colors* and *Spectrum colors arranged by chance* are perhaps two of his most famous works.
Needless to say, I instantly fell in love with its minimalistic paintings and *I HAD TO* try and replicate his work in some form of automated way.

*Why?* , I hear you asking.
Well, all I know is that *I had to*.

Each painting is completely unique and will never be replicated.
In order to achieve that goal, I implemented my own version of the `XOR128` random algorithm.

Feel free to click around and generate a painting until you find one that you like.

Then, you can download and keep it forever!
*I mean, it's file. For sure I won't be able to steal it.*
